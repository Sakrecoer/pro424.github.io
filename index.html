  <blockquote><p>PRO424 is the electronic music project of Swedish musician
  Maximilian Karlander.</p></blockquote><p>As inspiration is taken from
  everything from Radiohead, Boards of Canada, Biosphere, Maurizio, Deepchord,
  and so, the music spans over a several genres, often combining different
  styles and sounds.</p><p>In February 2011 Soundtrack of a Frozen Time was
  released. This was my first full length album and featured ambient inspired
  soft electronica with heavy influences from Pink Floyd, Biosphere and Moby.
  Songs from the album were at the time performed a few times and some of the
  songs are still performed today, though often in new versions. The album was
  self released. In december 2011 an EP, named Dreams, was released, yet again
  by myself. Most of the songs were written before Soundtrack of a Frozen time,
  however at the time the more ambient and instrumental sound appealed more and
  the songs on Dreams were put on hold to be finished later. When these songs
  were picked up again during the spring of 2011 they got a total make over with
  three of the songs getting a much rougher sound, while the final track was
  written during these sessions. Elin Grahn contributed vocals for At the end,
  while Lisa Ulfves helped make the front cover design.</p><p>After these two
  releases a lot happened and new inspirational sources, especially more techno,
  was introduced. After sort of a reboot, new music was taking shape in spring
  of 2013. A totally different approach was taken, where the music was written
  to be performed rather than previously just produced. During 2013 and 2014 new
  songs were tried and played at several shows all over Stockholm, mostly at
  open airs. These songs were reworked during this time and by mid 2014 a new
  album started taking shape. Record label <a target="_blank"
  href="https://www.lamour.se/">Lamour</a> picked up the music and in late March
  2015 Immune was released on Lamour. The 5-track full length album is an
  instrumental concept album, going from ambient to dark ambient
  techno.</p><p>In May 2016 a 4-track cassette was released on Lamour, named 424
  I. All tracks were improvisations recorded on a portastudio and mastered on
  reel to reel, making the cassette complete analog productions apart from a few
  digital synths.</p><p>As of June 2017 several new releases are being worked on
  however no concrete plans for release of this material exists. Some of this
  material is connected to Immune.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Booking and contact: <a
